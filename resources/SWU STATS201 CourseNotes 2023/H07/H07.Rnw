\frametitle{Example -- Weight of snapper as a function of length}

Those of you who fish in the Hauraki Gulf will know that the minimum legal size for
retaining a snapper is 30 cm.
Here, we want to use snapper length to explain snapper weight, and in particular
we want to estimate the weight of 30 cm snapper.

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
Note that this research question is highly relevant, 
since the relationship between length and weight is crucial for the 
stock assessments of snapper.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Weight of snapper as a function of length\ldots}
Clearly there is a non-linear relationship between weight and length.\\
\medskip
Geometry tells us that if an object changes in overall size while keeping the
same shape (i.e., same ratio between height, depth and length), 
then its volume will increase with the 3rd power of length.\\
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\item For a cube with sides of length $l$, $volume=len^3$.
\item For a sphere with radius $r$, $volume=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
That is, $volume \propto len^3$. In other words
\[ 
volume = k_1 \times len^3 
\]
for some constant $k_1$.\\
\medskip
Assuming weight of a solid object is proportional to its volume, we conclude
\[ 
weight = \alpha \times len^3
\]
for some constant $\alpha$.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Weight of snapper as a function of length\ldots}
Those of you who have caught snapper will know that they do exhibit a small change 
in shape as they grow larger, so it would be better to use the model
\[ 
weight = \alpha \times len^{\beta_1} 
\]
where $\beta_1$ is some constant that may be close to, but not necessarily equal to 3.\\
\medskip
Taking logs gives
\[ \log(weight) = \log(\alpha) + \beta_1 \times \log(len) \]
which we can rewrite as
\[ \log(weight) = \beta_0 +\beta_1 \times \log(len) \ . \]
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Weight of snapper as a function of length\ldots}
The formula on the previous slide specifies an assumed (i.e, expected) relationship between
$\log(weight)$ and $\log(len)$ of a snapper.\\
\medskip
Of course, snapper of a given length will have some variability in their weight,
just as humans of a given height vary in their weight.
So, what we are really saying is that the weight (kg) of an individual snapper of length $len$ (cm)
is
\[
\log(weight) = \beta_0 +\beta_1 \times \log(len) + \varepsilon 
\]
where $\varepsilon$ is some random variability (i.e., error around the expected value).

\medskip

The above formula should be of very familiar form to you by now. 
Provided that we make the assumption that $\varepsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ then this is precisely
the simple linear regression model with response variable $\log(weight)$ and
explanatory variable $\log(len)$.

\framesubtitle{Estimated weight of a 30cm snapper}

Recall that we wanted to estimate the weight of 30 cm snapper.
Since the linear model is fitted to log(wgt), we must back-transform,
and are making inference about median weight.

<<RC-H07-017, echo=1:2>>=
Pred.df=data.frame(len=30) 
exp(predict(Snap.lm,Pred.df,interval="confidence")) 
ci = exp(predict(Snap.lm,Pred.df,interval="confidence")) 
@
That is, we estimate 30 cm snapper to have median weight between \Sexpr{round(1000 * ci[2])} and \Sexpr{round(1000 * ci[3])} grams.
\medskip

\textbf{Note:} If the research question had asked up to {\em predict} the weight of a 30 cm 
snapper then we would use
<<RC-H07-018, echo=1>>=
exp(predict(Snap.lm,Pred.df,interval="prediction")) 
ci = exp(predict(Snap.lm,Pred.df,interval="prediction")) 
@
We predict a 30 cm snapper to weigh between about \Sexpr{round(1000 * ci[2])} and \Sexpr{round(1000 * ci[3])} grams.

\framesubtitle{Testing $H_0: \beta_1=3$}

A few slides earlier we deduced that the power coefficient $\beta_1$ should be close to,
though not necessarily equal to 3.\\
\bigskip
Let us examine this formally by testing the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_1=3$.\\
\bigskip
\textbf{Question 1} Is this hypothesis rejected at the 5\% level?
(Hint: the answer can be worked out from output already seen) \\
\bigskip
\textbf{Question 2} What is the \pval{} for $H_0: \beta_1=3$? (This takes a bit more work).
\bigskip

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{What is the \pval{}?}
<<RC-H07-019>>=
beta1 = coef(Snap.lm)[2]
seBeta1 = summary(Snap.lm)$coefficients[2,2]
hyp = 3
tstat = (beta1 - hyp)/seBeta1
tstat
pval = 2 * (1 - pt(abs(tstat), df = nrow(Snap.df) - 2))
pval
@
The \pval{} is so small that it been rounded down to zero.

If we really want to see the \pval{} then we can get the \rcode{pt} function 
to do the probability calculation on the log scale, and then exponentiate:\footnote{Not examinable}

<<RC-H07-019b>>=
logP = log(2)+pt(-abs(tstat), df = nrow(Snap.df) - 2, log.p = T)
exp(logP)
@
We see that the \pval() is in the order of $10^{-41}$, i.e., virtually zero.\footnote{By way of comparison, the earth has about $10^{50}$ atoms.}

@ 
In general, 
a power law model could be used whenever one has good reason to believe that the
relationship between $x$ and $y$ takes any of these forms.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Power relationships\ldots}
\framesubtitle{Interpretation of power curves}
Recall, we are fitting the model 
$\log(y)=\beta_0+\beta_1 \log(x)$, which is equivalent to
$y=e^{\beta_0}x^{\beta_1} =\alpha x^{\beta_1}$.

\medskip

For the snapper example the confidence interval for $\beta_1$ is 
<<RC-H07-013A, echo=1>>=
confint(Snap.lm)[2,]
ci = confint(Snap.lm)[2,]
@

One way to interpret this is to say that a 1\% increase in the $x=len$ value 
results in a \Sexpr{round(ci[1], 2)}\% to a \Sexpr{round(ci[2], 2)}\% increase in the median value of $y=wgt$.

\medskip

\textbf{Explanation:} Increasing $x$ by 1\% is the same as multiplying $x$ by 1.01.
So the  relative change in $y$ is: 

\vspace{-0.5em}

\[
\Delta y=\frac{\alpha (1.01x)^{\beta_1}}{\alpha x^{\beta_1}}
=\frac{\alpha x^{\beta_1}(1.01)^{\beta_1}}{\alpha x^{\beta_1}}=1.01^{\beta_1}
\]

\vspace{-1em}

$1.01^{\beta_1}\approx 1+\beta_1\times .01$ for reasonable values of $\beta_1$  (Taylor's series).
So, a 1\% increase in $x$ results in an approximate relative increase in $y$ of  $\Delta y\approx \beta_1\times .01$ or an increase of $\beta_1\%$
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Power relationships\ldots}
\framesubtitle{Interpretation of power curves\ldots}
Alternatively, it might be more meaningful to quantify the change in the median of $y$ arising from a 50\% increase in $x$, or perhaps a doubling of $x$, say 50\% increase in $x$: Then $y$ changes from $\alpha x^{\beta_1}$ to 

\[ \alpha (1.5x)^{\beta_1} =  \alpha x^{\beta_1} 1.5^{\beta_1} \]

i.e., the median of $y$ gets multiplied by $1.5^{\beta_1}$. \\

\bigskip

Doubling in $x$: Then $y$ changes from $\alpha x^{\beta_1}$ to 
\[ \alpha (2x)^{\beta_1} =  \alpha x^{\beta_1} 2^{\beta_1} \]
i.e., the median of $y$ gets multiplied by $2^{\beta_1}$.

@
That is, increasing length by 50\% corresponds to an increase in median
snapper weight between \Sexpr{round(100*(ci[1] - 1))}\% and \Sexpr{round(100*(ci[2] - 1))}\%\footnote{These percentages are given by \rcode{100*(1.5\^{}confint(Snap.lm)[2,]-1)}.}.
\footnote{One could also say that median snapper weight is between 2.06 and 2.14 times higher. Be careful {\bf not} to say that it is between 3.06 and 3.14 times higher (since it actually multiplies by between 3.06 and 3.14). It is probably safest to talk about \% change.}
