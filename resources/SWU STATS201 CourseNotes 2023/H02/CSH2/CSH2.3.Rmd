# Problem

This data set contains the prices of ladies' diamond rings and the carat size of their diamond stones from  a random sample of rings from Singaporean retailers. The rings are made of 20 carat\footnote{In the context of gold, ``carat'' refers to the purity of the gold.} gold and are each mounted with a single diamond stone. The data was collected by a lecturer quite a few years ago when they were in Singapore and they were interested in building a model to explain the price of diamond rings.

In particular, it was hoped that the prices of two rings could be predicted using the model: a 0.3-carat diamond ring and a 1.2-carat diamond ring.\footnote{In the context of diamonds, ``carat'' refers to the weight, specifically, one carat is 200 milligrams.} 

The variables measured were:

- `price`:  price of ring (in Singapore dollars)
- `weight`:	weight of diamond (in carats)



# Question of interest/goal of the study
We were interested in building a model to explain the price of diamond rings. In particular, we want to predict the price of a 0.3-carat diamond ring and a 1.2-carat diamond ring.  

# Read in and inspect the data:
```{r fig.height=3.5}
# import the data
diamonds.df=read.table("diamonds.txt", header=T)
head(diamonds.df)
plot(price~weight,main="Price versus weight of diamonds",data=diamonds.df)
```

# Comment on the plot

The scatter plot of price versus weight shows a strong, increasing, linear relationship. The greater the weight of the diamond, the greater the mean price of the diamond ring.

# Fit model and check assumptions
```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
# fit the model
diamond.fit<-lm(price~weight,data=diamonds.df)

#Assumption checks
plot(diamond.fit,which=1) 
normcheck(diamond.fit)
cooks20x(diamond.fit)

#Get summary output and confidence intervals
summary(diamond.fit)
confint(diamond.fit)
```

# Plot with superimposed line
```{r fig.height=3.5}
plot(price~weight,main="Price versus weight of diamonds",data=diamonds.df)
abline(diamond.fit$coef[1],diamond.fit$coef[2])

```


# Get additional predicted output required
```{r}
predweight.df=data.frame(weight=c(0.3,1.2))
predict(diamond.fit,predweight.df,interval="prediction")
```

# Method and Assumption Checks 
A scatter plot of price vs diamond weight showed a linear association with approximately constant
scatter and so a simple linear regression model was fitted. 

All the assumptions were met so we have no problems with the analysis.

Our final model is  $price_i=\beta_0 +\beta_1\times weight_i+\epsilon_i$ 
where $\epsilon_i \sim iid ~ N(0,\sigma^2)$.

Our model explains 98% of the variation in diamond ring prices.

# Executive Summary

We have data on diamond ring prices and the weights of the diamonds in those rings from Singapore retailers. Our aim is to predict the price of a diamond ring using the weight of the diamond.

There is a strong positive association between the weight of the diamond and the price of the ring -  the bigger the diamond, the higher the price of the diamond ring.

We estimate that for every 0.1-carat increase in the weight of the diamond, the mean diamond ring price increases by somewhere between $360 and $390.

Our model explains 98% of the variation in diamond ring prices and therefore should be excellent for predicting the price of diamond rings. 

Using our model, we predict that the 0.3-carat diamond ring will be priced between $790 and $920. 

Our data only has diamond rings weighing up to 0.35 carats, so we cannot rely on the predictions for the 1.2-carat ring.

[Note: the range of the orignal data was around 900 dollars, this has been reduced to around 130 dollars which is roughly 15% of this and much more useful for prediction.]
