# Problem
We wish to investigate the distribution of exam marks. In particular, we want to test the hypothesis that the underlying mean value of exam score is the ``historical average'' of 55.

The variable of interest is:

* `Exam`: Exam mark out of 100.

## Question of Interest
We were interested in building a model to describe exam marks. In particular, we want to test the hypothesis that the underlying mean value of exam score is the ``historical average'' of 55.

## Read in and Inspect Data
```{r, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
Stats20x.df = read.table("STATS20x.txt", header = T)
hist(Stats20x.df$Exam,xlab="Exam",main="")
summaryStats(Stats20x.df$Exam)
```
The exams marks are centred just above 50. The data look reasonably unimodal and symmetrical -- roughly normal. Some slight right-skewness, but does not look like a problem.

## Fitting the null model
### By hand...
```{r}
( mn_exam = mean(Stats20x.df$Exam) ) # Sample mean
( sd_exam = sd(Stats20x.df$Exam) ) # Sample standard deviation
( n_exam = length(Stats20x.df$Exam) ) # Sample size
( tmult_exam = qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = n_exam - 1) ) # t-multiplier
( CI_exam = mn_exam + tmult_exam * c(-1, 1) * sd_exam/sqrt(n_exam) ) # Confidence Interval
( se_exam = sd_exam/sqrt(n_exam) ) # Standard error
(t_stat_exam = (mn_exam - 55)/(se_exam) ) # t-stat
(pval_exam = 2 * (1 - pt(abs(t_stat_exam), df = n_exam - 1)) ) # p-value
```

### Using lm...
```{r}
examNull.fit55 = lm(I(Exam-55) ~ 1, data = Stats20x.df)
( pval_exam = coef(summary(examNull.fit55))[4] )
55+confint(examNull.fit55) 
```

### Finaly, with the t.test function
```{r}
t.test(Stats20x.df$Exam, mu = 55)
```

# Method and Assumption Checks
There are no explanatory variables, and so a null model was fitted.

From examining the histogram it appears that the data are roughly normally distributed, so model assumptions are satisfied. 

Our final model is 
$$Exam_i=\beta_0 + \epsilon_i \text{ (or }Exam_i=\mu + \epsilon_i \text{)} ~,$$ 
where $\epsilon_i \sim iid ~ N(0,\sigma^2)$ 

# Executive Summary

We were interested in building a model to describe exam marks.

We estimate the expected exam mark to be between 49.8 and 55.9 (out of 100).

We have no reason to believe that the expected exam mark differs from the historical average 
value of 55 (out of 100) (_P-value_ = 0.17).
